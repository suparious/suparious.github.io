# Nixon vs. Carter: Whose Policies Inflicted Deeper Economic Wounds?

## A Comprehensive Analysis of Long-Term Economic Impacts

This comprehensive research analyzes the long-term economic impacts of the executive orders and policies implemented by Presidents Richard Nixon (1969-1974) and Jimmy Carter (1977-1981), examining which president had the most negative effect on the economy, trade, the value of the US dollar, and inflation.

## Key Findings

- **Nixon's Nixon Shock (1971)** permanently transformed global finance by ending the Bretton Woods system, creating exchange rate volatility that persists today
- **Carter's appointment of Paul Volcker** to the Federal Reserve successfully ended the Great Inflation that Nixon's policies initiated
- **Deregulation begun under Carter** (not Reagan) enabled decades of economic innovation and efficiency gains
- **Manufacturing employment peaked under Carter** and began its decline due to trade imbalances created by Nixon's policies
- **Economic historians judge Nixon's legacy far more harshly** despite Carter leaving office with worse immediate economic metrics

## Summary

While Jimmy Carter left office with a 21.98% "misery index" and became synonymous with economic failure, Richard Nixon's policies created far more lasting structural damage to the American economy. The paradox that emerges from four decades of economic data and expert analysis shows that the president remembered for economic failure actually laid groundwork for recovery, while the one who claimed political success created lasting damage.

## Research Methodology

This analysis draws from:
- Federal Reserve Economic Data and historical archives
- Bureau of Labor Statistics employment and inflation statistics
- Academic research from NBER, Brookings, and major universities
- Historical analysis from the Miller Center and presidential libraries
- Contemporary accounts and policy documents from both administrations
